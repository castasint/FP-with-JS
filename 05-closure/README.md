# Closure

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with
references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a
closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In
JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function
creation time. - MDN
