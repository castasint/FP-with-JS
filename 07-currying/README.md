# Currying

    Currying is a transform that makes f(x,y,z) callable as f(x)(y)(z).

    Currying is transforming a function of N arguments in such a way that it can be called as a chain of N functions each with a single argument.

**Note that with currying, we're not invoking the function. We are just
transforming it.**
